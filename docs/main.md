integrating audio-over-IP technology into your applications. It supports widely adopted audio-over-IP protocols,

discovery and connection management, ST2022-7 for stream redundancy, and PTPv2 for precise time synchronization.

The SDK is written in modern C++17, and targets systems running macOS, Windows and Linux.
